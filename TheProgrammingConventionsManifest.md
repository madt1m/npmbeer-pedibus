# The Programming Conventions Manifest

In this paper we will define which will be the guidelines to follow when developing the modules which will compose our final application, such as: comment style, naming style, programming paradigms and so on. 
For anything that comes up to your mind, feel free to modify this document an insert a new paragraph. Of course, as the name says, we're speaking about conventions therefore everyone should be agree with them.

## Naming
All the variables, classes, methods, classes etc.. naming should be set in english and should follow the standard 
conventions defined for that specific environment, e.g. the `camelCase` convention for Java variables, 
`lowercase_separated_by_underscores` for MongoDB collection and field names etc..
Here is a link to the Wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)

Reminder: in a Spring environment naming is very important, since the framework will automatically link and construct
objects, methods and classes basing on it.

### Files

### Classes
[JAVA] `UpperCamelCase` format is to be used. 

### Variables
[JAVA] `camelCase` format is to be used

### Methods
[JAVA] `camelCase` format is to be used

## Comments

The more, the better.

A brief description of any implemented method should be included (in a javadoc compliant format in case of Java methods)

See: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-137868.html#writingdoccomments

Always comment salient steps inside the code such as condition checking, variable names or other operations.

All the comments should be made in English.
